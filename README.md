# RSG

## Mission

Random text generation is fun.
I've created this engine 
for committed funmakers,
including myself.

The engine is written in PHP, 
and supports the use of HTML.
The database script language
is not JSON nor XML,
but plain text, similar to
Makefile.

It was a design guideline that
the engine should be suitable for
Hungarian language, because 
it's so complicated, that
other languages will also work then.

## You are the author

If you want to write a good program,
a good compiler is only a tool.
Also, this RSG engine is only a tool.
Good quality result requires 
**lot** of quality content.
RSG is not an easy genre.
